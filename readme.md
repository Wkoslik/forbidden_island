#Project One: Forbidden Island

# Forbidden Island

**Objective**

Collect treasures before the island sinks **and** escape the island.

**Game Set Up**

* 24 Island Locations
* 28 Treasure Cards
* 24 Flood Cards

**Game Play**

The game alternates between the player turn and the "island" turn.
* Player
    * 3 Actions:
        * Move
        * Unflood a tile
        * Exchange 4 treasure cards for a treasure (at specific locations only.)
    * At the end of their turn, the player draws two treasure cards*
* Island
    * Flood the numer of tiles equal to the water level
        *  (*) If "waters rise" was triggered at the end of the layers turn (by pulling a "waters rise" card from teh Treasure Deck), the Flood discard pile is shuffled and then put back on top of the Flood deck **before** additional tiles are flooded. 
            *  if a currently flooded tile is pulled again, that tile disappears into the sea, never to be seen again.
